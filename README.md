# Closest Pair of Points Algorithms

This project evaluates two algorithms for solving the closest pair of points problem:
1. **Brute Force Algorithm**
2. **Divide and Conquer Algorithm**

## Problem Description

Given `n` points in a 2D plane, the task is to find the pair of points that is closest together. This notebook measures runtime for input sizes `n = 5000`, `n = 10000`, `n = 15000`, ..., `n = 50000`, with `n` taking 10 values from 5k to 50k in increments of 5k.
